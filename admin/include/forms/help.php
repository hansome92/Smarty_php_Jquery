<p>If you need help for DaDaBIK you can read the <b>documentation</b> (the file documentation.htm you get together with DaDaBIK code files), which also contains the answers to some Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs).</p>


<p>If you still need technical support and you purchased DaDaBIK Enterprise version, you can write an email to <strong>support at dadabik dot org</strong>, you have 5 email support tickets to use in one year. We can read English, Italian, Spanish, French. If you purchased DaDaBIK Basic/Pro or you have finished your support tickets, you have to use the public <a href="http://www.dadabik.org/forum">forum</a> instead.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.dadabik.org/forum">forum</a> is anyway a great source of knowledge for all users, with 10,000+ posts published by the DaDaBIK community during the last years. Beside the Support forum (both in English and Italian) there are a Feature requests forum and a General Discussion forum.
